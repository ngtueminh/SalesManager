<p><strong>This is a project to build a sales management database. Creating a sales database helps businesses efficiently manage their operations and interact with customers. The database is designed to optimize the sales process, enabling structured creation and management. The sales management database consists of relationships: Customers, employees, products, invoices, and invoice details. These are all essential and fundamental pieces of information that any business or business model needs to have and grasp. Depending on the scale of the business, additional relationships may be introduced. In this project, the main focus is to enhance one's skills in information management and practice the use of SQL programming language.</strong></p>
